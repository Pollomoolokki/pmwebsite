Source for my website

My website: https://pollomoolokki.tez.page/

To help me understand how to host my website (on IPFS, with the aforementioned domain) I've used this guide:
https://medium.com/pinata/how-to-easily-host-a-website-on-ipfs-9d842b5d6a01

My website (contents) are hosted on https://app.pinata.cloud/
and I've used https://app.tezos.domains/ -site to register my .tez domain.
