Source for my website & painting images

My website: https://pollomoolokki.tez.page/

I switched to https://fleek.co for hosting my website. I've used https://app.tezos.domains/ -site to register my .tez domain.

To help me understand how to host my website (on IPFS, with the aforementioned domain) I've used this guide:

My website (contents) used to be hosted on https://app.pinata.cloud/ (IPFS)
