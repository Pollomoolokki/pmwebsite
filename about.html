<h1>About I&I</h1>

<p></p>
<p>This is I&I. Notice the guitars and the yellow fabric glued to the mic. The original fabric wore to shreds. "To shreds I say!"</p>

<h2>Pollomoolokki</h2>
<p>
Hello everyone, I'm Pollomoolokki! I like to collect <a href="https://opensea.io/Pollomoolokki?search[sortBy]=LISTING_DATE&search[query]=42">#42</a> mints. I also collect <a href="https://objkt.com/profile/pollomoolokki/owned">Objkt:s</a></p>
<p>Owner of <a href="https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/landsharknft">landsharknft</a> <a href="https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/asset/1099580794881">#4</a></p>
<h2>Study</h2>
<p>I'm a student of information technology. Degree in Automotive and Transportation Engineering . Linux user for ~5 years, daily linux user for ~3 years. I love to nerd it out and I've been studying (as a hobby) blockchains and cryptocurrencies for ~4 years as they so nicely coincide :D I was intrigued and agreed with what the bitcoin whitepaper said when I decided to read upon the subject a bit more</p>
<p>
I like to develop my skills further everyday with lifelong learning in mind.
</p>

<h2>Art</h2>
<p>I like to paint, photograph and digitally edit things. I have started my painting journey with watercolors. Some of my paintings have been inspired by photographs that I took from places/things that I thought really beautiful. Most of my edited pictures have been made from my paintings.</p>
<h2>Ramblings</h2>
<p>I also love to write and I've had the most fun thinking about the paintings and their backstories. But in my heart I'm an <strong>academic</strong> and in my head an <strong>engineer</strong>. It is exactly why I have started writing about security on my "important stuff" tab. Even though I enjoy writing stories (I have not written any real stories), I want to use my time to write about real stuff. Important stuff. I think security is the most important. I have started the writing process by reading... ðŸ¤“ðŸ˜€ I have listed some references, the topmost two relates the most to security and are most unknown to me.</p>

<p>
Lifelong learning is one of the driving force for me and the website came to be because of it. I was amazed how buying a domain can be an NFT on the blockchain and it all just magically works... I have to host my website on IPFS but that's nothing. I could run my own IPFS 'node'... I'd just need a rasberry pi (I might have to think about buying one) Also I must say that writing this website has helped me grasp version control a little bit more. All of this website (the html5&css source) is on github and the license is the most permissive... Which means you could fork the code and make your own website! It requires some knowledge (Just a wee bit of html5&css) but we're all lifelong learners and I believe in your skills! I've also provided a guide on how to get a domain&host your website.</p>
<p>
Anyway I digress... What I want to convey with my ramblings on this site: What I want to state as a fact must come from an reputable source (peer review references, cross-references from other sources etc...) As I earlier stated, I'm an academic and I want to prove it in my endless ramblings.</p>
<p>
I have read the book <a href="https://fb2bookfree.com/uploads/files/2019-06/1560825442_meditations-by-emperor-of-rome-marcus-aurelius.pdf">Meditations by Marcus Aurelius</a> and I must say I enjoyed the philosophy presented: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a></p>
