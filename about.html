<p>This is me. Notice the guitars and the yellow fabric glued to the mic. The original fabric wore to shreds. "To shreds I say!"</p>

Hello everyone, I'm Pollomoolokki! </br>

I'm a student of information technology. Linux user for ~5 years, daily linux user for ~3 years. I love to nerd it out and I've been studying (as a hobby) blockchains and cryptocurrencies for ~4 years as they so nicely coincide :D I was intrigued and agreed with what the bitcoin whitepaper said when I decided to read upon the subject a bit more</br>


I like to paint, photograph and digitally edit things. I have started my painting journey with watercolors. Most of my paintings have been inspired by photographs that I took from places/things that I thought really beautiful. Most of my edited pictures have been made from my paintings.</br>
I also love to write and I've had the most fun thinking about the paintings and their backstories.</br>

I like to develop my skills further everyday with lifelong learning in mind.
